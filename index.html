        <h1>Kristin Galea</h1>
        <p><em>Artist, Personal Chef, Optician, and Web Developer</em></p>
        <p>My first vocation is in art and design. I've worked in many different mediums such as: ceramics, sculpture, acrylic paint, mixed media, photography, and more.
          Later in life I transitioned into the culinary world. I focused in French cooking techniques, Latin American and Middle Eastern cuisine, and different types of bakes. I am currently an optician, practicing since 2019.
          I am very proud of my position and I've worked hard to achieve the level of success I am at.
          However my passion lies in my ability to create. As time goes on I feel a need to be in a career that fosters my natural abilities.
          I have been wanting to break into the tech industry since 2018 in the the role of web developer. Currently, I am seeking the education needed to fulfill this transition.
           This is the first website I've ever built, and I am using it for practice purposes. Currently, the page only has HTML for structure, and CSS for style. Eventually I will be adding JavaScript for the behavioral characteristics.</p>
